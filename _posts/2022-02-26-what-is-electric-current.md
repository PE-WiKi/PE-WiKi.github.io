Electric current starts from electrons' movement. Electron is a subatom, and it has 1.60217662 Ã— 10e-19 C in it. ELectric current is very similar to the flow of water. Let' see belows.

# Water Flow

Water drips and turns the water wheel to generate power.  

# Current

Waterwheel's rolling resistance to water drop and water drop can be modeled as a single electric resistance, voltage source each.  

Electrons can flow through conductors like metal, semiconductor.
