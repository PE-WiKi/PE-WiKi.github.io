# Introduction  
Operational amplifiers is an essential component in electronic devices.

Operational amplifiers (op amps) are incredibly useful high-performance differential amplifiers that can be employed in a number of amazing ways. A typical op amp is an integrated device with a non-inverting input, an inverting input, two dc power supply leads (positive and negative), an output terminal, and a few other specialized leads used for fine-tuning. The positive and negative supply leads, as well as the fine-tuning leads, are often omitted from circuit schematics. If you do not see any supply leads, assume that a dual supply is being used. Note that we have labeled the supply voltages +$$V_{s}$$ and âˆ’$$V_{s}$$, as they are usually the same. However, they do not need to be.
