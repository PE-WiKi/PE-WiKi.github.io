# Introduction  
In mathematics, a differential equation is an equation that relates one or more unknown functions and their derivatives. In applications, the functions generally represent physical quantities, the derivatives represent their rates of change, and the differential equation defines a relationship between the two. Mainly **the study of differential equations consists of the study of their solutions** (the set of functions that satisfy each equation), and of the properties of their solutions. 

# Types  
## Ordinary differential equations  
Ordinary differential equation (ODE) is a differential equation containing one or more functions of one independent variable and the derivatives of those functions. The term ordinary is used in contrast with the term partial differential equation which may be with respect to more than one independent variable.  

$$
a_{0}(x)y+a_{1}(x)y'+a_{2}(x)y''+\cdots +a_{n}(x)y^{(n)}+b(x)=0
$$  

where $$a_{0}(x)$$, $$a_{n}(x)$$ and $$b(x)$$ are arbitrary differentiable functions that do not need to be linear, and $$y', ..., y^{(n)}$$ are the successive derivatives of the unknown function y of the variable x.
