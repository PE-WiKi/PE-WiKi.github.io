# What is passive elements?  
In grammar, a passive verb or sentence is one in which the subject is affected by the action. In electric circuit, resistor, capacitor, inductor are the passive elements. Passive elements are affected by electrons' flow.  

## Resistor  
Materials in general have a characteristic behavior of resisting the flow of electric charge. This physical property, or ability to resist current, is known as resistance and is represented by the symbol R. The larger the resistance, the more difficult it is for current to flow. 

## Capacitor  
A capacitor is a passive element designed to store energy in its electric field.

## Inductor  
An inductor is a passive element designed to store energy in its magnetic field.

If you use passive elements in combination, you can make helpful an effective system that will acheive your goals.
